# Version 2.6.0 (release: 11.12.2020)

You can see the full list of issues with details in the [milestones page](https://github.com/daust/opal-tools/milestone/10?closed=1). 

## New features
  * see [milestones page](https://github.com/daust/opal-tools/milestone/10?closed=1)
  * changed names in documentation and the default in the setup routine, so that it matches the video and instructions:
    - ``scott hr`` => ``schema1 schema2``

## Bug fixes
  * see [milestones page](https://github.com/daust/opal-tools/milestone/10?closed=1)

## Changed behaviour
  * OPTIONAL: The naming of ``SourceFilesCopy.txt`` and ``SourceFilesReference.txt`` to ``SourceFilesCopy.conf`` and ``SourceFilesReference.conf``. These files are called from the shell scripts and passed as parameters. Your existing patches will continue to work. New releases will generate different patch-templates that will use these different filenames in the filesystem and call them automatically in the shell scripts. 
  * MANDATORY: In order to streamline the naming of properties, the following attributes have changed in the ``opal-installer.json`` file (else these properties will no longer be read):
    - ``matchRegEx => fileRegex``
    - ``sqlFileRegEx => sqlFileRegex``
